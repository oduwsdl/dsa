DSA1 or [AlNoamany's Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091508), was the first algorithm developed for summarizing web archive collections via social media storytelling. Web archive collections usually consist of thousands of documents and review of these documents is time consuming for humans. With DSA1, a user can automatically summarize and visualize a web archive collection from a small sample of archived web pages (mementos) drawn from the larger collection. The goal is to allow a user to get the gist of the collection without having to spend time reviewing all of their contents. The DSA1 algorithm was originally designed for use with Storify (shown above). It has since been updated and generalized for use with other visualization outputs, like the DSA Puddles web site (shown below).

The DSA1 algorithm was originally developed by Yasmin AlNoamany and published in [Generating Stories From Archived Collections](https://doi.org/10.1145/3091478.3091508). It is represented by the diagram below.

The DSA Toolkit application [Raintale](https://oduwsdl.github.io/raintale/) takes care of the **visualize** step in the above diagram while the [Hypercane](https://oduwsdl.github.io/hypercane/) application takes care of the other steps.
