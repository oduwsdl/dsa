SHARI - StoryGraph Hypercane ArchiveNow Raintale Integration - applies several tools from the StoryGraph and [Dark and Stormy Archives Projects](http://oduwsdl.github.io/dsa) to summarize the news of a given day. With SHARI stories, users can explore the news stories of the present or past visualized as a series of cards. The DSA project displays SHARI stories on the DSA Puddles web site, as shown above. This folder houses scripts and other documentation on the SHARI process so we can document and improve it over time.

# In This Folder

* `CHANGELOG.md` - a changelog recording a history of changes to the process
* `scripts` - the generic scripts used in the SHARI process
* `templates` - the templates used by SHARI
