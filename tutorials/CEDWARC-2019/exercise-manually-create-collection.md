# Exercise: Gather resources for your story â€“ manually 

To gather resources manually, we must search using the Interface of our web archive.
* Archive-It allows us to explore a collection via searching. For information on searching Archive-It, see: https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/208002196-Browse-and-search-on-archive-it-org
* Search for the people, places, etc. that reflect the story you wish to tell
* From these searches, choose mementos and record their URLs
  - e.g., https://wayback.archive-it.org/7760/20160825195540/http://dailysignal.com/2016/08/18/im-from-louisiana-heres-the-flooding-story-the-media-should-cover/
* There are 1000s of mementos to sift through
* We need to choose around 28 mementos because that is the number used in popular stories

Steps for this exercise:

1. Visit https://archive-it.org/collections/3649
2. View the individual seeds and browse the collection
3. Determine which questions you want your story to answer
    1. The 5W/1H Questions?
    2. Something else?
4. Review the collection to see what you can find.
5. In this case, record the URLs of 5 mementos that you think will help you answer the questions of your story
