# Dark and Stormy Archives

This is the central repository for the [Dark and Stormy Archives Project](https://oduwsdl.github.io/dsa/). The Dark and Stormy Archives (DSA) project exists to provide storytelling solutions to improve the understanding of web archive collections. With search engines, collection users must first have a query in mind. What if the user does not know enough about the collection to form a query? Our goal is to provide a "summary of summaries" in the form of social media storytelling that describes a collection sufficiently for a user to decide if that collection merits further time.

While other repositories associated with the DSA may contain code for specific components, this repository contains scripts, lessons, and other documentation that ties everything together.

## The Repositories of the DSA Project

* [Archive-It Utilities](https://github.com/oduwsdl/archiveit_utilities) - a library that scrapes Archive-It to gather information on seeds and metadata
* [MementoEmbed](https://github.com/oduwsdl/MementoEmbed) - an web service application for producing a visualization of a single memento
* [Raintale](https://github.com/oduwsdl/raintale/) - a command line application for visualizing stories of mementos
* [Hypercane](https://github.com/oduwsdl/hypercane) - a set of commands for intelligently sampling mementos from web archive collections
* [DSA Puddles](https://github.com/oduwsdl/dsa-puddles) ([gh-pages branch](https://github.com/oduwsdl/dsa-puddles/tree/gh-pages)) - a web site of visualizations produced by the DSA Project

## The structure of this site

* `algorithms` - overarching documentation and scripts about using these tools to implement specific algorithms
* `tutorials` - lessons on how archivists can leverage applications from the DSA toolkit to solve various problems
